# Neal-s-Pizza-Diner

In this project, my aim was to create a web application of a certain pizza restaurant as a way of trying to widen my customer base.
So in this web application, my cutomers will be able to order different sizes of pizzas, with different kinds of crusts and with toppings of their choice.

This project was done solely by me, Neal Waga.

There are no bugs or issues that would corrupt your system. So you have nothing to worry about.

In this project, I managed to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript for its functionality. 
I also managed to use jQuery show and hide effect.
I also used the JavaScript confirm()method.

If you encounter any problems, have questions or want to pitch ideas or suggestions, do not hesitate to reach out and contact me at waganeal@gmail.com .
It will be much appreciated.
